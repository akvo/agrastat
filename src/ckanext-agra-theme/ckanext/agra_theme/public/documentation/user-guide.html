<h1>User guide<a class="headerlink" href="#user-guide" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>This user guide covers using AGRASTAT’s web interface to organize, publish and find data. AGRASTAT also has a powerful API (machine interface), which makes it easy to develop extensions and links with other information systems. The API is documented in <a class="reference internal" href="api/index.html"><span class="doc">API guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>Some web UI features relating to site administration are available only to
users with sysadmin status, and are documented in <a class="reference internal" href="sysadmin-guide.html"><span class="doc">Sysadmin guide</span></a>.</p>
<section id="what-is-agrastat">
<h2>What is AGRASTAT?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-agrastat" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>AGRASTAT is a tool for share data based on CKAN. (Think of a content management
system like WordPress - but for data, instead of pages and blog posts.) It
helps you manage and publish collections of data. It is used by national and
local governments, research institutions, and other organizations who collect a
lot of data.</p>
<p>Once your data is published, users can use its faceted search features to
browse and find the data they need, and preview it using maps, graphs and
tables - whether they are developers, journalists, researchers, NGOs, citizens,
or even your own staff.</p>
<section id="datasets-and-resources">
<h3>Datasets and resources<a class="headerlink" href="#datasets-and-resources" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>For AGRASTAT purposes, data is published in units called “datasets”. A dataset is a
parcel of data - for example, it could be the crime statistics for a region,
the spending figures for a government department, or temperature readings from
various weather stations. When users search for data, the search results they
see will be individual datasets.</p>
<p>A dataset contains two things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Information or “metadata” about the data. For example, the title and
publisher, date, what formats it is available in, what license it is released
under, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>A number of “resources”, which hold the data itself. AGRASTAT does not mind what
format the data is in. A resource can be a CSV or Excel spreadsheet, XML file,
PDF document, image file, linked data in RDF format, etc. AGRASTAT can store the
resource internally, or store it simply as a link, the resource itself being
elsewhere on the web. A dataset can contain any number of resources. For
example, different resources might contain the data for different years, or
they might contain the same data in different formats.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>On early AGRASTAT versions, datasets were called “packages” and this name
has stuck in some places, specially internally and on API calls. Package has
exactly the same meaning as “dataset”.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="users-organizations-and-authorization">
<h3>Users, organizations and authorization<a class="headerlink" href="#users-organizations-and-authorization" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>AGRASTAT users can register user accounts and log in. Normally (depending on the
site setup), login is not needed to search for and find data, but is needed for
all publishing functions: datasets can be created, edited, etc by users with
the appropriate permissions.</p>
<p>Normally, each dataset is owned by an “organization”. A AGRASTAT instance can have
any number of organizations. For example, if AGRASTAT is being used as a data
portal by a national government, the organizations might be different
government departments, each of which publishes data. Each organization can
have its own workflow and authorizations, allowing it to manage its own
publishing process.</p>
<p>An organization’s administrators can add individual users to it, with
different roles depending on the level of authorization needed. A user in an
organization can create a dataset owned by that organization. In the default
setup, this dataset is initially private, and visible only to other users in
the same organization. When it is ready for publication, it can be published at
the press of a button. This may require a higher authorization level within the
organization.</p>
<p>Datasets cannot normally be created except within organizations. It is
possible, however, to set up AGRASTAT to allow datasets not owned by any
organization. Such datasets can be edited by any logged-in user, creating the
possibility of a wiki-like datahub.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The user guide covers all the main features of the web user interface (UI).
In practice, depending on how the site is configured, some of these functions
may be slightly different or unavailable. For example, in an official AGRASTAT
instance in a production setting, the site administrator will probably have
made it impossible for users to create new organizations via the UI. You can
try out all the features described at <a class="reference external" href="http://demo.AGRASTAT.org">http://demo.AGRASTAT.org</a>.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Registration is needed for most publishing features and for personalization
features, such as “following” datasets. It is not needed to search for and
download data.</p>
</div>
<p>To create a user ID, use the “Register” link at the top of any page. AGRASTAT will
ask for the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Username</em> – choose a username using only letters, numbers, - and _ characters.
For example, “jbloggs” or “joe_bloggs93”.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Full name</em> – to be displayed on your user profile</p></li>
<li><p><em>E-mail address</em> – this will not be visible to other users</p></li>
<li><p><em>Password</em> – enter the same password in both boxes</p></li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/register_account.jpg" src="_images/register_account.jpg" />
<p>If there are problems with any of the fields, AGRASTAT will tell you the problem
and enable you to correct it. When the fields are filled in correctly, AGRASTAT
will create your user account and automatically log you in.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is perfectly possible to have more than one user account attached to the
same e-mail address. For this reason, choose a username you will remember, as
you will need it when logging in.</p>

<span id="id1"></span><h4>Adding a new dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-new-dataset" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You may need to be a member of an organization in order to add and edit
datsets. See the section <a class="reference internal" href="#creating-an-organization"><span class="std std-ref">Creating an organization</span></a> below. On
<a class="reference external" href="https://agrastat.akvotest.org">https://agrastat.akvotest.org</a>, you can add a dataset without being in an organization,
but dataset features relating to authorization and organizations will not be
available.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. You can access AGRASTAT’s “Create dataset” screen in two ways.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Select the “Datasets” link at the top of any page. From this, above the
search box, select the “Add Dataset” button.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, select the “organizations” link at the top of a page. Now
select the page for the organization that should own your new dataset. Provided
that you are a member of this organization, you can now select the “Add
Dataset” button above the search box.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. AGRASTAT will ask for the following information about your data. (The
actual data will be added in step 4.)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Title</em> – this title will be unique across AGRASTAT, so make it brief but specific.
E.g. “UK population density by region” is better than “Population figures”.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description</em> – You can add a longer description of the dataset here, including
information such as where the data is from and any information that people will
need to know when using the data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tags</em> – here you may add tags that will help people find the data and link it
with other related data. Examples could be “population”, “crime”, “East
Anglia”. Hit the &lt;return&gt; key between tags. If you enter a tag wrongly, you can
use its delete button to remove it before saving the dataset.</p></li>
<li><p><em>License</em> – it is important to include license information so that people know
how they can use the data. This field should be a drop-down box. If you need to
use a license not on the list, contact your site administrator.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Organization</em> - If you are a member of any organizations, this drop-down will
enable you to choose which one should own the dataset. Ensure the default
chosen is the correct one before you proceed. (Probably most users will be in
only one organization. If this is you, AGRASTAT will have chosen your organization
by default and you need not do anything.)</p></li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/add_dataset_1.jpg" src="_images/add_dataset_1.jpg" />
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>By default, the only required field on this page is the title. However, it
is good practice to include, at the minimum, a short description and, if
possible, the license information. You should ensure that you choose the
correct organization for the dataset, since at present, this cannot be changed
later. You can edit or add to the other fields later.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. When you have filled in the information on this page, select the “Next: Add
Data” button. (Alternatively select “Cancel” to discard the information filled
in.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. AGRASTAT will display the “Add data” screen.</p>
<img alt="_images/add_dataset_2.jpg" src="_images/add_dataset_2.jpg" />
<p>This is where you will add one or more “resources” which contain the data for
this dataset. Choose a file or link for your data resource and select the
appropriate choice at the top of the screen:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you are giving AGRASTAT a link to the data, like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://example.com/mydata.csv</span></code>, then select “Link to a file” or “Link to an
API”. (If you don’t know what an API is, you don’t need to worry about this
option - select “Link to a file”.)</p></li>
<li><p>If the data to be added to AGRASTAT is in a file on your computer, select “Upload
a file”. AGRASTAT will give you a file browser to select it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>. Add the other information on the page. AGRASTAT does not require this
information, but it is good practice to add it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Name</em> – a name for this resource, e.g. “Population density 2011, CSV”.
Different resources in the dataset should have different names.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description</em> – a short description of the resource.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Format</em> – the file format of the resource, e.g. CSV (comma-separated
values), XLS, JSON, PDF, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>. If you have more resources (files or links) to add to the dataset, select
the “Save &amp; add another” button. When you have finished adding resources,
select “Next: Additional Info”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>. AGRASTAT displays the “Additional data” screen.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Visibility</em> – a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Public</span></code> dataset is public and can be seen by any user of the
site. A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Private</span></code> dataset can only be seen by members of the organization owning
the dataset and will not show up in searches by other users.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Author</em> – The name of the person or organization responsible for producing
the data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Author e-mail</em> – an e-mail address for the author, to which queries about
the data should be sent.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Maintainer / maintainer e-mail</em> – If necessary, details for a second person
responsible for the data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Custom fields</em> – If you want the dataset to have another field, you can add
the field name and value here. E.g. “Year of publication”. Note that if there
is an extra field that is needed for a large number of datasets, you should
talk to your site administrator about changing the default schema and dataset
forms.</p></li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/add_dataset_3.jpg" src="_images/add_dataset_3.jpg" />
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Everything on this screen is optional, but you should ensure the
“Visibility” is set correctly. It is also good practice to ensure an Author is
named.</p>
</div>
<div class="versionchanged">
<p><span class="versionmodified changed">Changed in version 2.2: </span>Previous versions of AGRASTAT used to allow adding the dataset to existing
groups in this step. This was changed. To add a dataset to an existing group
now, go to the “Group” tab in the Dataset’s page.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>. Select the ‘Finish’ button. AGRASTAT creates the dataset and shows you
the result. You have finished!</p>
<p>You should be able to find your dataset by typing the title, or some relevant
words from the description, into the search box on any page in your AGRASTAT
instance. For more information about finding data, see the section

<p>In general, each dataset is owned by one organization. Each organization
includes certain users, who can modify its datasets and create new ones.
Different levels of access privileges within an organization can be given to
users, e.g. some users might be able to edit datasets but not create new ones,
or to create datasets but not publish them. Each organization has a home page,
where users can find some information about the organization and search within
its datasets. This allows different data publishing departments, bodies, etc to
control their own publishing policies.</p>
<p>To create an organization:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Select the “Organizations” link at the top of any page.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the “Add Organization” button below the search box.</p></li>
<li><p>AGRASTAT displays the “Create an Organization” page.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a name for the organization, and, optionally, a description and image
URL for the organization’s home page.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the “Create Organization” button. AGRASTAT creates your organization and
displays its home page. Initially, of course, the organization has no datasets.</p></li>
</ol>
<img alt="_images/create_organization.jpg" src="_images/create_organization.jpg" />
<p>You can now change the access privileges to the organization for other users -
see <a class="reference internal" href="#managing-an-organization"><span class="std std-ref">Managing an organization</span></a> below. You can also create datasets owned by the
organization; see <a class="reference internal" href="#adding-a-new-dataset"><span class="std std-ref">Adding a new dataset</span></a> above.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

box. When you select this, AGRASTAT displays the organization admin page. This page
has two tabs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Info</em> – Here you can edit the information supplied when the organization

<li><p>Repeat the search, altering some terms</p></li>
<li><p>Restrict the search to datasets with particular tags, data formats, etc using
the filters in the left-hand column</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If there are a large number of results, the filters can be very helpful, since
you can combine filters, selectively adding and removing them, and modify and
repeat the search with existing filters still in place.</p>
<p>If datasets are tagged by geographical area, it is also possible to run AGRASTAT
with an extension which allows searching and filtering of datasets by selecting
an area on a map.</p>

<h4>Searching within an organization<a class="headerlink" href="#searching-within-an-organization" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>If you want to look for data owned by a particular organization, you can search
within that organization from its home page in AGRASTAT.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Select the “Organizations” link at the top of any page.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the organization you are interested in. AGRASTAT will display your
organization’s home page.</p></li>
<li><p>Type your search query in the main search box on the page.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>AGRASTAT will return search results as normal, but restricted to datasets from the
organization.</p>
<p>If the organization is of interest, you can opt to be notified of changes to it
(such as new datasets and modifications to datasets) by using the “Follow”
button on the organization page. See the section <a class="reference internal" href="#managing-your-news-feed"><span class="std std-ref">Managing your news feed</span></a>

<h4>Exploring datasets<a class="headerlink" href="#exploring-datasets" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>When you have found a dataset you are interested and selected it, AGRASTAT will
display the dataset page. This includes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The name, description, and other information about the dataset</p></li>
<li><p>Links to and brief descriptions of each of the resources</p></li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/exploring_datasets.jpg" src="_images/exploring_datasets.jpg" />
<p>The resource descriptions link to a dedicated page for each resource. This
resource page includes information about the resource, and enables it to be
downloaded. Many types of resource can also be previewed directly on the
resource page. .CSV and .XLS spreadsheets are previewed in a grid view, with
map and graph views also available if the data is suitable. The resource page
will also preview resources if they are common image types, PDF, or HTML.</p>
<p>The dataset page also has two other tabs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Activity stream</em> – see the history of recent changes to the dataset</p></li>
<li><p><em>Groups</em> – see any group associated with this dataset.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the dataset is of interest, you can opt to be notified of changes to it by

<section id="search-in-detail">
<h3>Search in detail<a class="headerlink" href="#search-in-detail" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>AGRASTAT supports two search modes, both are used from the same search field.
If the search terms entered into the search field contain no colon (“:”)
AGRASTAT will perform a simple search. If the search expression does contain at
least one colon (“:”) AGRASTAT will perform an advanced search.</p>
<section id="simple-search">
<h4>Simple Search<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-search" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>AGRASTAT defers most of the search to Solr and by default it uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/the-dismax-query-parser.html">DisMax Query
Parser</a>
that was primarily designed to be easy to use and to accept almost any input
without returning an error.</p>
<p>The search words typed by the user in the search box defines the main “query”
constituting the essence of the search. The + and - characters are
treated as <strong>mandatory</strong> and <strong>prohibited</strong> modifiers for terms. Text wrapped
in balanced quote characters (for example, “San Jose”) is treated as a phrase.
By default, all words or phrases specified by the user are treated as
<strong>optional</strong> unless they are preceded by a “+” or a “-“.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>AGRASTAT will search for the <strong>complete</strong> word and when doing simple search are
wildcards are not supported.</p>
</div>
<p>Simple search examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">census</span></code> will search for all the datasets containing the word “census” in
the query fields.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">census</span> <span class="pre">+2019</span></code> will search for all the datasets contaning the word “census”
and filter only those matching also “2019” as it is treated as mandatory.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">census</span> <span class="pre">-2019</span></code> will search for all the datasets containing the word
“census” and will exclude “2019” from the results as it is treated as
prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;european</span> <span class="pre">census&quot;</span></code> will search for all the datasets containing the phrase
“european census”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Solr applies some preprocessing and stemming when searching. Stemmers remove
morphological affixes from words, leaving only the word stem. This may cause,
for example, that searching for “testing” or “tested” will show also results
containing the word “test”.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Testing</span></code> will search for all the datasets containing the word “Testing”
and also “Test” as it is the stem of “Testing”.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If the Name of the dataset contains words separated by “-” it will consider
each word independently in the search.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="advanced-search">
<h4>Advanced Search<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-search" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>If the query has a colon in it it will be considered a fielded search and the
query syntax of Solr will be used to search. This will allow us to use wildcards
“*”, proximity matching “~” and general features described in Solr docs.
The basic syntax is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">field:term</span></code>.</p>
<p>Advanced Search Examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title:european</span></code> this will look for all the datasets containing in its
title the word “european”.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title:europ*</span></code> this will look for all the datasets containing in its title
a word that starts with “europ” like “europe” and “european”.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title:europe</span> <span class="pre">||</span> <span class="pre">title:africa</span></code> will look for datasets containing “europe”
or “africa” in its title.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title:</span> <span class="pre">&quot;european</span> <span class="pre">census&quot;</span> <span class="pre">~</span> <span class="pre">4</span></code> A proximity search looks for terms that
are within a specific distance from one another. This example will look for
datasets which title contains the words “european” and “census” within a
distance of 4 words.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">author:powell~</span></code> AGRASTAT supports fuzzy searches based on the Levenshtein
Distance, or Edit Distance algorithm. To do a fuzzy search use the “~”
symbol at the end of a single-word term. In this example words like
“jowell” or “pomell” will also be found.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Field names used in advanced search may differ from Datasets Attributes,
the mapping rules are defined in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">schema.xml</span></code> file. You can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title</span></code>
to search by the dataset name and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span></code> to look in a catch-all field that
includes author, license, mantainer, tags, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>AGRASTAT uses Apache Solr as its search engine. For further details check the
<a class="reference external" href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/searching.html#searching">Solr documentation</a>.
Please note that AGRASTAT sometimes uses different values than what is mentioned
in that documentation. Also note that not the whole functionality is offered
through the simplified search interface in AGRASTAT or it can differ due to
extensions or local development in your AGRASTAT instance.</p>
